'''
This is an app im going to make for pc and try to make for android.
The point of this app is to automate all the convertions i may have to make (like C to F, miles to km, lb to kg,...)
Maybe I will expand this later to do more than just convert things.


from PyQt5.QtWidgets import *

app = QApplication([])
window = QWidget()
layout = QVBoxLayout()
layout.addWidget(QPushButton('Top'))
layout.addWidget(QPushButton('Bottom'))
window.setLayout(layout)
window.show()
app.exec()'''
