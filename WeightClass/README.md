# WeightClass
This is a project i'm working on to make an automated shopping list. 

How this is going to work is simple, first of all i need to organize my pantry. 
Once that is done we need to put sensors under different places to weight the total weight of everything that is on top. 
Once we have this data we can send it to our python program who will calculate how much we have left. 
If he we don't have enough it will automatically add the specific item to a shopping list.

We will have this shopping list and the amount of products we have on a website.

Completed:
-Add button
-table with all the products
-automatic evaluation if we need to buy the product or not

Still to do:
-delete button
-update a product
-the automated shopping list
