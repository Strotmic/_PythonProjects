# PyhtonStage
The python files i made for my traineeship in my last year of Secondary school

These files don't contain the passwords and usernames i used from the company. 
You wont be able to run this because this has my local database linked and it doesnt have any odatafeeds to extract from.
These files succesfully auto created 105 sql tables and inserted 600.000 rows, without a single fault one.(for obvious privacy reasons i cant share these)
